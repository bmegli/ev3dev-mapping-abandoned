# ev3dev-mapping-abandoned
The completely abandoned unsupported and unlicensed test code

This is more-or-less the code that was originally used to make:

1.  [How to interface XV11 LIDAR to EV3 using ev3dev ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6uVg34VzHw)
2.  [EV3 Gyro vs CruizCore XG1300L vs Odometry - Position Estimation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzND_ISdhEs)
	
This code is unlicensed - you are free to do whatever you want with it

This code is unsupported - no explanations

This code is abandoned - no plans to do anything with it in the future

Check out other [ev3dev-mapping](https://github.com/bmegli/ev3dev-mapping) repositories for a friendlier, supported and up-to-date code.
