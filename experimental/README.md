# ev3dev-mapping

Experimental code!

Personal test code that was originally not intended to be published!

- Comes as is 
- Originally meant to get experience from it and then write the "true code".
- Doesn't follow so called "best practices", e.g. in WPF MVC pattern is completely ignored, in C - code is added in one big file. 
- ev3-side code is better. It at least checks all the errors, frees resources etc, has structure.
- pc-side code is worse. Test content just thrown in.
